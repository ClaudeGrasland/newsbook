We will use as example, the dataset corresponding to the newspaper Le Monde, available from 15-03-2013 to 30-06-2020. 5.1 Data preparation The file is initially stored in quanteda format (qd) but can be transformed easily in tidytext format (tt). We are indeed interested here to compare the performance of both software for the purpose of tagging. # load quanteda file qd&lt;-readRDS(&quot;_data/qd/fr_FRA_lmonde_20130315_20200630.Rdata&quot;) #transform in tidytext tt&lt;-tidy(qd) 5.1.1 Breaking bad … As long as we are interested in the research of co_location of tokens, it is crucial to examine if the association of words are observed in the same text (several sentences) or in the same sentence (with possible differentiation between title and description).
